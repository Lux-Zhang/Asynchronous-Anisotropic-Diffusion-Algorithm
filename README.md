# Asynchronous-Anisotropic-Diffusion-Algorithm
This is a demo for AAD algorithm. The subroutine of the anisotropic diffusion algorithm is modified from Mr. Michael Aye's repository in https://github.com/michaelaye/pymars/blob/ca62a17c682f999c490cc0dbceb01433c385ced0/pymars/anisodiff2D.py.
We have provided the code of Asynchronous-Anisotropic-Diffusion-Algorithm, and the _Optics Express_ paper here, please access the data we used refer to https://github.com/BJTUSensor/AD-algorithm/blob/main/data.mat.

Operating environment: Python 3.7
